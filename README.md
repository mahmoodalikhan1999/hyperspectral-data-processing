# Satellite Imagery Shape_files to CSVs
The CSVs Generator.ipynb Jupyter notebook is designed for processing geospatial and hyperspectral data, specifically for analyzing land characteristics using hyperspectral imaging. The core functionality of the code involves reading a hyperspectral TIFF image and a shapefile, extracting pixel values and coordinates from the hyperspectral image within defined polygon areas, and generating a CSV file that contains relevant data. This data includes properties from the shapefile, the X and Y coordinates, and band values from the hyperspectral image for each pixel within the polygon areas.

The notebook uses specialized Python libraries such as geopandas, rasterio, shapely, and fiona, which are essential for handling geographic and spatial data. These libraries allow for the manipulation of raster and vector data, making them suitable for geospatial analyses. The primary input files for the notebook are a hyperspectral TIFF image (e.g., GoogleEarth_image_with_L_Band.tif) and a shapefile (e.g., barren.shp), which defines the polygons for the areas of interest. After processing, the output is saved as a CSV file (e.g., barren.csv) that combines data from both the shapefile and the hyperspectral image.

This code is particularly useful for projects focused on land use analysis or solar panel site assessment, with a specific emphasis on analyzing barren land areas. It facilitates the extraction of meaningful data from hyperspectral images, which can be used to assess land characteristics, such as suitability for solar energy projects. To run the notebook, users need to install the required libraries and prepare the necessary input files. Upon execution, the notebook processes the data and outputs a CSV file containing the extracted information.
